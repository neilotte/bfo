# Proposed BFO 1.2

This is a temporary home for files related to the [proposed BFO 1.2 release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QQsfTtzclBrW7PxMdyRGsaQ7pQZIYVkShgVRP5f4VNo/edit). [Please report bugs and suggest improvements!](https://github.com/ontodev/bfo/issues)

The bfo12.owl file contains proposed classes and relations with logical axioms and annotations. We have yet to add `owl:previousVersion` annotations based on the [Mapping Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnbOUYWIQYUEdF9yb0hlUjhBUGRnVWNTVFJQX0xOUlE).

If your ontology uses [ruttenberg-bfo2.owl](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/2010-05-25/ruttenberg-bfo2.owl) then you should be able to replace that import with [bfo12.owl](https://github.com/ontodev/bfo/blob/master/bfo12.owl). Please report any problems you may have.
